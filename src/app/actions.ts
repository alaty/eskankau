// This file is currently not used for forecasting as the logic has been moved to the client-side
// in ForecastClient.tsx. It's kept here in case server-side actions are needed for other features in the future.

// Example of what it might contain if needed later:
// import { someAction } from "@/lib/some-module";
// export async function performSomeAction(input: any) {
//   // ... server-side logic
// }
